rtctree is a library for managing RT Components in Python.

## Overview 

rtctree is a Python library for managing RT Components with a simple API. Developers can manage RT Component systems from other programs without knowing the CORBA API.
It is possible to activate and deactivate components, and to connect components to each other.

This software is developed by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology with support from NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization) under the Next-Generation Robot Intelligence Technology Development Project.

## Requirements

- ominorb-py, omniidl, and the Python module for omniidl are required.
- Python 2.6 or later is required because features that do not exist in Python 2.5 or earlier are used.
- If you are using Ubuntu 9.04, you need to manually install Python 2.6. Therefore, Ubuntu 9.04 or later is recommended.

## Installation

Several installation methods are available.

- Download from the repository (see [Repository](#repo) below) or from the source archive, extract it in an appropriate directory, and install it:
  1. Extract the source.
```
 $ cd /home/blurgle/src/
 $ tar -xvzf rtctree-2.0.0.tar.gz
```
  1. Run setup.py.
```
 $ python setup.py install
```
  1. Set environment variables as needed. These are set by default, but if they are not set, you need to set them yourself. On Windows, make sure that the Python site-packages directory is set in the **PYTHONPATH** environment variable, and that the Python script directory is set in the **PATH** environment variable. Normally, these are **C:\\Python26\\Lib\\site-packages\\** and **C:\\Python26\\Scripts\\** (if Python is installed in **C:\\Python26\\**).

- On Windows, using the installer is recommended. Using setup.py makes the result easier to configure. However, depending on the environment, additional environment variable settings may be required.


## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used.

<table class="table-alt">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>RTCTREE_ORB_ARGS</strong></td>
    <td>A semicolon-separated list of arguments given when creating the ORB. This does not need to be set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS</strong></td>
    <td>A semicolon-separated list of name server addresses for the RTC tree. The servers written in this variable are added to the tree. This does not need to be set.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Normally, RTCTREE_ORB_ARGS does not need to be set. Setting RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS makes using rtctree more convenient. For example, in a Bash shell:

```
 $ export RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS=localhost;192.168.0.1:65346;example.com
```

## RTC Tree

The main part of the library is the RTC tree.
```
 import rtctree.tree
 tree = rtctree.tree.RTCTree()
```
This is a file-system-like tree created by searching name servers to obtain naming contexts, components, and managers. It can be handled exactly like a normal file system. The tree represents naming contexts, managers, and components registered with all known name servers in a tree structure.

```
 \  
 |-+localhost
 | |-+naming_context
 | | |--ConsoleIn0.rtc</td>
 | | |--ConsoleOut0.rtc</td>
 | |
 | |--another_naming_context</td>
 | |--Sensor0.rtc</td>
 | 
 |-+192.168.0.5</td>
   |--Motor0.rtc</td>
   |--Controller0.rtc</td>
```

Each directory in the tree is either a normal naming context or the root context of a name server. The root context of a name server is represented by the **NameServer** class. A naming context is represented by the **'Directory'** class, and a manager is represented by the **Manager** class.

Name servers are treated as directories from the root directory. Under them are files and subdirectories. Subdirectories represent naming contexts and managers under the root context.

Files are components and managers. Components are represented by the Component class.

A component object stores various information about the component it represents. You can activate and deactivate components, manage component ports, connect ports, and set configuration settings.

Managers can create new component instances and delete components.

All nodes in the tree also store references to the CORBA objects represented by those nodes. By accessing these objects, you can call IDL methods. Even if there is a function that is currently not available in rtctree, you can use this CORBA object to call IDL methods directly.


### Building the Tree

The arguments of the tree factory function (**create_tree()**) specify the name servers to be parsed in order to build the tree. For details, refer to the documentation for that function. In general, you can build a tree by passing a list of name server addresses or a list of paths. The environment variable **RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS** is also checked.

### Paths 

Nodes in the tree are specified by paths. A path is a list of strings. Each level to the right is one level deeper than the one to the left. An absolute path is required to specify a tree object. If the path exists under a node, a relative path from that node can also be specified.

These path strings are similar to file system path specifications. The root of the tree is indicated by `/` (or `\` on Windows). The first level is the name server address. The levels below it are components, managers, and naming contexts (shown as directories). The function **parse_path** converts a string path into a path for the RTC tree.

For example, the following path:
```
 /localhost/naming_context/ConsoleIn0.rtc
```
indicates a component named **ConsoleIn0.rtc** registered under **naming_context** of the name server running on **localhost**. When you want to obtain the object of that component from the tree, you need to convert the path into a Python list using **parse_path**.
```
 ['/', 'localhost', 'naming_context', 'ConsoleIn0.rtc']
```

### Helper Functions

The following are helper functions for the RTCTree class and various node classes. This does not show all APIs. Refer to the API documentation written with Doxygen. For examples, refer to the rtcshell source.

## API Style

rtctree follows the standard Python style. Refer to [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

The most important point is that private internal API functions begin with an underscore ("_"). Functions that begin with an underscore should not be accessed from outside the class. If they are used, undefined behavior may occur. Use only functions that do not begin with an underscore and that have docstrings.
