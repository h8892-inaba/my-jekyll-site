In the Execution Context View, you can display a list of execution contexts (ECs) to which the selected RTC belongs, start/stop ECs, execute RTC actions, and attach/detach RTCs to/from ECs. You can also set the execution cycle of ECs.

The value being edited for the execution rate is not applied until the [Apply] button in ⑥ is clicked. Information being modified (not yet applied) is displayed in light red. If the input value is invalid, it is displayed in red.

In the online editor, you can operate ECs and change the state of RTCs on those ECs.<br>
Click the [Start] button to start the EC, and the state property becomes "RUNNING". Click the [Stop] button to stop the EC, and state becomes "STOPPING".<br>
To change the state of an RTC on an EC, click the [Activate] or [Deactivate] button. When activated, the component_state property becomes "ACTIVE", and when deactivated, component_state becomes "INACTIVE".<br>
If an RTC enters the "ERROR" state for some reason, click the [Reset] button to recover it.

An RTC can be attached to multiple ECs.<br>
Select the EC to which you want to add the RTC, and click the [Attach] button. The RTC selection dialog opens. The selection dialog displays a list of RTCs in the System Editor.
