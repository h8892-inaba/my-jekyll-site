This section explains connections between data ports and between service ports.

### Data Port Connections
For data port connections, connect an "InPort" and an "OutPort". When you connect them by drag and drop, the following dialog is displayed. Note that the "Buffer" setting items are hidden when the dialog is initially displayed.

The dialog items and conditions are as follows.

For items ② through ⑤, RT System Editor creates the selectable values by matching strings from the value lists of each port.
If only ANY is specified for both ports, it is not possible to determine the values that can be entered.
For this reason, when ANY is included in both ports, RT System Editor allows arbitrary strings to be entered. Items for which arbitrary strings can be entered display "Arbitrary input allowed".

### Service Port Connections
For service port connections, connect a "ServicePort" and a "ServicePort". When you connect them by drag and drop, the following dialog is displayed.
<br>

<div align="center"><a href="fig59ServiceConnectDailog.png"><img src="fig59ServiceConnectDailog.png" width="70%;"></a></div>
<div align="center"><strong>Service Port Connector Profile Dialog</strong></div>
<br>

The dialog items and conditions are as follows.
<br>

<div align="center"><strong>Dialog Items and Requirements for Service Port Connections</strong></div>

<table class="table-alt">
  <tr>
    <td>No.</td>
    <td>Dialog Item Name</td>
    <td>ConnectorProfile</td>
    <td>Requirements</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>①</td>

    <td>Name</td>
    <td>None in particular</td>

    <td>Details</td>
    <td>―</td>
    <td>When the checkbox is checked, detailed setting items for Consumer/Provider are displayed.<br>They are hidden when the dialog is initially displayed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>③</td>
    <td>Consumer</td>
    <td>―</td>
    <td>
Select from the list of Consumers of the interfaces set for the service ports to be connected.
The selection list in the ComboBox is displayed in the format &lt;component name&gt;:&lt;interface name&gt;:&lt;instance name&gt;.
<br>
The added Consumer/Provider pair is stored in the ConnectorProfile with the Consumer ID as the property key and the Provider ID as the property value.
<br>
The Consumer/Provider IDs are represented in the following format.
&lt;rtc_name&gt;.port.&lt;port_name&gt;.&lt;if_polality&gt;.&lt;if_tname&gt;.&lt;if_iname&gt;
<br>
<ul>
<li>rtc_name is the component name</li>
<li>port_name is the port name</li>
<li>if_polality is "required" for Consumer and "provided" for Provider</li>
<li>if_tname is the type name of the interface</li>
<li>if_iname is the instance name of the interface</li>
</ul>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>④</td>
    <td>Provider</td>
    <td>&lt;&lt;properties&gt;&gt;<br>Set with the Consumer ID as the key</td>
    <td>As with Consumer, select from the list of Providers of the interfaces set for the service ports to be connected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>⑤</td>
    <td>Add</td>
    <td>―</td>
    <td>Adds a new Consumer/Provider entry.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>⑥</td>
    <td>Delete</td>
    <td>―</td>
    <td>Deletes the selected Consumer/Provider entry.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>⑦<br>⑧</td>
    <td>Name/Value</td>
    <td>&lt;&lt;properties&gt;&gt;<br>Name</td>
    <td>Sets arbitrary properties<br>Items can be added with the [Add] button and deleted with the [Delete] button.<br>The entered items are set in the Properties of the ConnectorProfile in NVList format.<br>Properties with the same Key cannot be set.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For service ports, there are no required connection conditions. However, if the PortInterfaceProfiles between the ServicePorts do not match completely (*1), a warning is displayed in the connection dialog.
<br>

<div align="center"><a href="fig60ServicePortWarningDialog.png"><img src="fig60ServicePortWarningDialog.png" width="60%;"></a></div>
<div align="center"><strong>Warning Display in the Service Port Connection Dialog</strong></div>
<br>

<strong>*1</strong>

A complete match here means that the "type" of the PortInterfaceProfiles is the same and that the "polarity" values are PROVIDED and REQUIred for each other.
It also means that all PortInterfaceProfiles match without any excess (each port can have multiple PortInterfaceProfiles).
