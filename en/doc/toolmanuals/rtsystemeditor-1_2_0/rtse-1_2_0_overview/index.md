### Overview of OpenRTM-aist RT System Editor
At present, [OMG](http://www.omg.org) is developing specifications for Robot Technology Components (hereafter RTCs), which improve the efficiency of robot development.
As a common platform that implements and applies these RTC specifications, the Integrated Intelligence Research Group, Intelligent Systems Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), provides [OpenRTM-aist]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/installation/lets_start).<br>
RTSystemEditor is one of the development tools included in OpenRTM-aist, and it provides functions for graphically operating RTCs in real time.
Also, as its name suggests, it is created as a plugin for the Eclipse integrated development environment, and can be operated seamlessly with existing plugins on Eclipse.

### Target Audience
This document is intended for those who already have basic knowledge of RTCs.
For details about RTCs, refer to the documents from [OMG](http://www.omg.org) or [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/aboutopenrtm/rtmiddleware).
