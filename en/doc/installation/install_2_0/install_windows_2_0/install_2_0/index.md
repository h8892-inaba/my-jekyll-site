### Visual Studio

Visual Studio is required not only for C++ development, but also for building installers when creating RTCs in Python or Java.
Install the free Community Edition below, or obtain and install Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019/2022 separately.

- [Microsoft **Download Visual Studio 2022**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ja/downloads/?utm_source=mscom&utm_campaign=msdocs)

The latest version of Visual Studio currently verified to work is 2022. <br>
It is common to forget to install the C++ development environment. We recommend reading the following guide.
  - [Installing Visual Studio Community 2022]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/installation/install_1_2/cpp_1_2/install_windows_1_2/visual_studio_1_2/visual_studio_2022)

### Python

Python is required not only for developing RTCs in Python but also for various OpenRTM-aist tools.
The versions of Python supported by OpenRTM-aist are 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
We recommend installing the latest version.

- [Python Releases for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
  - [python-3.11.1-amd64.exe (64-bit version)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-amd64.exe)

Please note the following when installing:

  - The Python installation directory can be specified by selecting [Customize installation] during installation.
  - For instructions on specifying the installation directory using [Customize installation], refer to the following page:
    - [Get Started with OpenRTM-aist in 10 Minutes! - Installing Python]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/installation/lets_start#toc1)

### CMake

CMake is required to automatically generate build files such as Visual Studio project files on Windows and Makefiles on Linux. <br>
Install the latest version whenever possible.

- [CMake (Version 3.11 or later recommended)](https://cmake.org/download/)
  - [cmake-3.29.3-windows-x86_64.msi (64-bit version)](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.29.3/cmake-3.29.3-windows-x86_64.msi)
  - During installation, it is recommended to select [Add CMake to the system PATH for all users] on the [Install Option] screen.

### Doxygen & Graphviz

Doxygen is a tool that automatically generates documentation from source code comments. <br>
Graphviz is required for generating diagrams such as class diagrams when creating documentation with Doxygen. <br>
In OpenRTM-aist, RTCBuilder allows you to enter various design information during RTC design, which is output as source code comments.
Processing these comments with Doxygen enables the generation of well-formatted RTC documentation. <br>
Install the latest versions whenever possible.

- [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/download.html#latestsrc)
  - [doxygen-1.11.0-setup.exe](https://www.doxygen.nl/files/doxygen-1.11.0-setup.exe) (No distinction between 32-bit and 64-bit versions)
  - If you cannot download it using Microsoft Edge, refer to the OpenRTM-aist download instructions:
    - [Get Started with OpenRTM-aist in 10 Minutes! - Downloading OpenRTM-aist]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/installation/lets_start#toc2)

&aname(Graphviz);
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/)
  - [windows_10_cmake_Release_graphviz-install-11.0.0-win64.exe](https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4207231/packages/generic/graphviz-releases/11.0.0/windows_10_cmake_Release_graphviz-install-11.0.0-win64.exe)

During installation, you will be asked how to configure the system PATH under [Install Options]. It is recommended to select "Add Graphviz to the system PATH for all users".

Download and run the Windows binary executable from the website above to install Graphviz.

After installation, run `dot -v` from the command prompt and verify that plugin information is displayed.

```text
