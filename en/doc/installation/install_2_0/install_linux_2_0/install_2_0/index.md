OpenRTM-aist provides deb packages that can be used on Ubuntu and Debian GNU Linux.
<!-- ２.０は現在、Debian、Ubuntu、Raspbian OSのディストリビューションに対応しています。 -->


#contents

2.0 currently supports Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 (amd64 and arm64 for each).
Please note that supported versions for Ubuntu/Debian GNU Linux and availability of support may change without notice.

## Changes in the 2.0 Series

C++ and OpenRTP can now coexist between the 1.2 series and the 2.0 series. With this support, the following installation-related items have changed.

- The deb package names for the 2.0 series have been changed
- Python and Java cannot coexist between the 1.2 series and the 2.0 series
  - If you use the batch installation script, installed different versions are automatically uninstalled
- The batch installation scripts for the 1.2 series and the 2.0 series have been separated
  - Installation of the 1.2 series: pkg_install_ubuntu.sh
  - Installation of the 2.0 series: openrtm2_install_ubuntu.sh

In addition, the installation scripts (for both the 1.2 series and the 2.0 series) now support batch processing from download to installation.

## Batch Installation Script

To install the 2.0 series, paste the following into the shell prompt and execute it. The C++ version, Python version, Java version, OpenRTP (amd64 only), rtshell, and JDK8 will be installed. The script is not saved locally.<br>
* Even if multiple versions of Java are installed by running the script, it is switched to use Java 8

```
 $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist/master/scripts/openrtm2_install_ubuntu.sh)
```

By executing this, the following deb packages and rtshell via pip are installed.

```

&color(fuchsia){On Ubuntu 24.04, rtshell installation fails when using the default pip version. Follow the yellow message displayed by the installation script, add the following to /etc/pip.conf (create it if it does not exist), and then run the installation script again to install it.};

```
 $ vi /etc/pip.conf
 [global]
 break-system-packages = true
```

By specifying options, you can install packages according to your purpose. help can be checked as follows.

```
 $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist/master/scripts/openrtm2_install_ubuntu.sh) --help
```

The detailed contents of the installed packages can be checked in "[Detailed Contents of the OpenRTM-aist-2.0 deb Packages]({{ site.baseurl }}/ja/node/6665)".

## Installing Packages for ROS

In the 2.0 series, packages for ROS communication functions can be installed. (For ROS and ROS2) <br>
This section explains how to install packages in an environment where both ROS and ROS2 are installed.

As described in help, the ROS package installation options are supported as follows.<br>
[-e ros|ros2|all] [--ros|--ros2]

If you have already run the installation script without options and want to additionally install packages for ROS and ROS2, this can be done with "-l c++ -e all".<br>
<span style="color:fuchsia;">In environments of Ubuntu 22.04 or later where only ROS2 is supported, only packages for ROS2 are installed with -e all.</span>;


```
 $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist/master/scripts/openrtm2_install_ubuntu.sh) -l c++ -e all
```

If you want to install everything including packages for ROS and ROS2 from the beginning, this can be done with "-l all -e all".
```
 $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist/master/scripts/openrtm2_install_ubuntu.sh) -l all -e all
```

Check the installed packages.

```

## Installing the 2.0 Series in an Environment Where the 1.2 Series Is Installed

The installation script for the 1.2 series can also be executed by specifying a URL. Install all packages by running the script without options.

```
 $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist/master/scripts/pkg_install_ubuntu.sh)
```

Check the installed packages.

```
 $ dpkg -l | grep openrt
 ii  openrtm-aist:amd64                         1.2.2-0
 ii  openrtm-aist-dev:amd64                   1.2.2-0

 ii  openrtp:amd64                                  1.2.2-4
```

If you then install the 2.0 series, c++ and openrtp from the 1.2 series and the 2.0 series coexist, but only the 2.0 series is installed for java and python.

```
 $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist/master/scripts/openrtm2_install_ubuntu.sh)
```

During script execution, you will be asked "Do you want to continue? [Y/n]" regarding the uninstallation of the 1.2 series java and python packages, so press the Enter key. <br>
Check the installed packages.
