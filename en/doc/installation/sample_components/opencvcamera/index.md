Please note that this sample is not included with the Python or Java editions of OpenRTM-aist. On Linux, build and install it according to [Building OpenCV Sample Code on Linux]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/installation/sample_components/opencv_sample_build).

### Overview

By starting OpenCVCamera and CameraViewer, images captured from a USB camera can be displayed on a monitor. OpenCV image-processing sample RTC components can be connected between them to apply various effects.

### Usage

OpenCVCamera is a sample component that acquires image data from a USB camera and displays it on a monitor through the CameraViewer component.

OpenCV RT sample components can also be inserted between them to apply image-processing effects.

- Procedure

  - Start RTSystemEditor and open a new SystemEditor. For details on using RTSystemEditor, refer to [RTSystemEditor]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/toolmanuals/rtsystemeditor-1_2_0).

  - Start both OpenCVCamera (openCVCamera.bat) and CameraViewer (CameraViewer.bat).

    - To use the sample OpenCV image-processing RT components, launch them after installation from:
      Start > OpenRTM-aist 1.2.1 x86_64 > C++_OpenCV-Examples
      (On a 32-bit environment:
      Start > OpenRTM-aist 1.2.1 x86 > C++_OpenCV-Examples)

  - These components will appear in the Name Service View of RTSystemEditor. Drag both of them onto the SystemEditor.

  - Connect the corresponding ports of the two components. (Refer to the RTSystemEditor execution example above.)

  - Right-click either component and select [Activate Systems].

### Using OpenCV Flip

  - Start the Flip component from:
    Start > OpenRTM-aist 1.2.1 x86_64 > C++_OpenCV-Examples
    (On a 32-bit environment:
    Start > OpenRTM-aist 1.2.1 x86 > C++_OpenCV-Examples)

  - Drag it onto the SystemEditor, connect it between OpenCVCamera and CameraViewer, and activate it. (Refer to the Flip execution example below.)

  - The Flip component can also modify its output by changing the value of the Configuration parameter "flip_mode." (Refer to the flip_mode example below.)

    - For detailed usage and explanations of Flip, see [here](http://www.openrtm.org/openrtm/en/node/6057).
