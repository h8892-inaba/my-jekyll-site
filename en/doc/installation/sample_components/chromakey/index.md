Please note that this sample is not included with the Python or Java editions of OpenRTM-aist. On Linux, build and install it according to [Building OpenCV Sample Code on Linux]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/installation/sample_components/opencv_sample_build).

### Overview

Chromakey is a sample OpenCV component that performs chroma key compositing of two images.

It is used together with OpenCVCamera and CameraViewer.

### Usage

Chromakey is an RTC component that implements a technique called chroma key compositing. It makes a specific color in an image transparent (for example, green used as a background during shooting) and composites it with another image. To run it, start two OpenCVCamera components to capture two images. CameraViewer is used for displaying the output.

- Procedure (Windows Environment)

  - Start OpenRTP and RTSystemEditor according to [Procedure for Starting OpenRTP (1.2 Series, Windows)]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/installation/install_1_2/start_openrtp_proc_windows_1_2), and make sure the RTCs are displayed in the Name Service View. For details on using RTSystemEditor, refer to [RTSystemEditor]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/toolmanuals/rtsystemeditor-1_2_0).

  - Open a command prompt with administrator privileges so that two OpenCVCamera components can be executed.

  - Edit rtc.conf. For example, enter the following commands:

```text
cd "\Program Files\OpenRTM-aist\1.2.1\Components\C++\OpenCV\vc14"
notepad rtc.conf
```

  Add the following line:

```text
manager.components.naming_policy: ns_unique
```

    - Close the command prompt.

  - In Explorer, navigate to \Program Files\OpenRTM-aist\1.2.1\Components\C++\OpenCV.

  - Double-click CameraViewer.bat.

  - Double-click OpenCVCamera.bat.

  - Double-click OpenCVCamera.bat again.

  - Double-click Chromakey.bat.

  - In the RTSystemEditor Name Service View, click [>] and confirm that the started components CameraViewer0, Chromakey0, OpenCVCamera0, and OpenCVCamera1 are displayed.

  - In RTSystemEditor, click the [Open New System Editor] button <a href="icon_open_editor_ja.png"><img src="icon_open_editor_ja.png" width="4%;"></a> at the top of the screen to open a new System Editor and display a new [System Diagram].

  - Drag and drop the four components above onto the System Diagram.

  - Connect the ports of each component as shown below.

  - Right-click the OpenCVCamera0 component and select [Activate]. If it does not turn green, select the component, open the Configuration View at the bottom, click [Edit], change device_num to the number corresponding to the USB camera used for capturing the foreground image, and click [Apply].

  - Right-click the OpenCVCamera1 component and select [Activate]. If it does not turn green, select the component, open the Configuration View at the bottom, click [Edit], change device_num to the number corresponding to the USB camera used for capturing the background image, and click [Apply].

  - Right-click any component and select [Activate Systems].

  - Move the windows around and display the CameraViewer window.

  - Click the Chromakey0 component in the [System Diagram] (System Editor View). The Configuration View will appear at the bottom. If it does not appear, click the [Configuration] tab.

  - Click the [Edit] button to configure the chroma key color.

    Set the values of lower_blue, upper_blue, lower_green, upper_green, lower_red, and upper_red to the RGB component ranges (blue, green, and red) of the color that should be made transparent in the foreground image background (green in this example).

  - Click the [Apply] button.

  - Confirm that the two images are composited as shown below.
