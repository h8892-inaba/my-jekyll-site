Please note that this sample is not included with the Python or Java editions of OpenRTM-aist. On Linux, build and install it according to [Building OpenCV Sample Code on Linux]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/installation/sample_components/opencv_sample_build).


### Overview

ObjectTracking is a sample OpenCV component that tracks an object selected on the screen and indicates its position by enclosing it with a red ellipse.

It is used together with OpenCVCamera and CameraViewer.

### Usage

ObjectTracking is a component that tracks an object selected on the screen and displays its position enclosed by a red ellipse. In this example, it is used together with the OpenCVCamera component for capturing images from a USB camera and the CameraViewer component for displaying processed images and selecting objects with the mouse.

The following describes usage on Windows.

- Procedure

  - Start OpenRTP and RTSystemEditor according to [Procedure for Starting OpenRTP (1.2 Series, Windows)]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/installation/install_1_2/start_openrtp_proc_windows_1_2), and ensure that RTCs are displayed in the Name Service View. For details on using RTSystemEditor, refer to [RTSystemEditor]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/toolmanuals/rtsystemeditor-1_2_0).

  - In Explorer, navigate to:

```text
\Program Files\OpenRTM-aist\1.2.1\Components\C++\OpenCV
```

  - Double-click CameraViewer.bat.

  - Double-click OpenCVCamera.bat.

  - Double-click ObjectTracker.bat.

  - In the RTSystemEditor Name Service View, click [>] and confirm that the CameraViewer, ObjectTracking, and OpenCVCamera components are displayed.

  - In RTSystemEditor, click the [Open New System Editor] button <a href="icon_open_editor_ja.png"><img src="icon_open_editor_ja.png" width="4%;"></a> at the top of the screen to open a new System Editor and display a new [System Diagram].

  - Drag and drop the above three components onto the System Diagram.

  - Connect the ports of each component as shown below.

<div align="center"><strong>ObjectTracking Component Connections</strong></div>

  - Right-click any component and select [Activate Systems].

  - Arrange the windows so that the CameraViewer window is visible.

<div align="center"><strong>ObjectTracking Output Image</strong></div>

  - While holding down the left mouse button, select the object you want to track. A rectangular selection area should appear as an inverted-highlight rectangle. (Depending on the environment, it may take some time before the selection rectangle becomes available.)

  - If the selection is successful, a red ellipse will appear as shown in the figure above. Physically move the selected object and confirm that the ellipse moves together with the object on the screen.

  - The histogram of the selected image region is briefly displayed from the "img_histgram" OutPort when the rectangular selection is made.
