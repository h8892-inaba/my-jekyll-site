## TkMotorComp

This sample is included with the Python edition of OpenRTM-aist.

Please note that it is not included with the C++ or Java editions.

### Overview

This is a sample RT Component with a GUI interface. The sample component can be started by running:

```text
TkMotorComp.bat
```

## SliderComp

This sample is included with the Python edition of OpenRTM-aist.

Please note that it is not included with the C++ or Java editions.

### Overview

This is a sample RT Component with a GUI interface. The sample component can be started by running:

```text

### Usage

SliderComp and TkMotorComp together provide a GUI-based simulation environment in which slider controls are used to control motor rotation.

- Procedure

  - Start RTSystemEditor and open a new SystemEditor.

    For details on using RTSystemEditor, refer to:

    [RTSystemEditor]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/doc/toolmanuals/rtsystemeditor-1_2_0)

  - Start both components:

    ```text
    SliderComp.bat
    TkMotorComp.bat
    ```

  - Both components will appear in the Name Service View of RTSystemEditor. Drag them onto the SystemEditor.

  - Connect the corresponding ports of the two components. (Refer to the RTSystemEditor example shown above.)

  - Right-click either component and select:

    ```text
    [Activate Systems]
    ```

  - In the TkMotorComp GUI, a set of rotating disks representing motor-driven actuators will be displayed.

  - Verify that the rotation of these disks can be controlled using the vertical slider knobs in the SliderComp GUI.

  - The six slider knobs correspond to six simulated motor rotations.
