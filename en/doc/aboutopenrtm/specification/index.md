#contents

OpenRTM-aist consists of an RT Component Framework, RT Middleware, a collection of basic RT Components, libraries, basic services, and development tools.

The RT Component Framework provides the base classes required to create RT Components. All RT Components are implemented as subclasses of these base classes.

RT Middleware is responsible for loading RT Component modules created using the framework, managing their lifecycle (including instance creation and destruction), and registering components with the Naming Service.

OpenRTM-aist also includes libraries that improve usability, basic services such as RT Component registration and discovery (currently using the CORBA Naming Service), RTCBuilder for generating RT Component skeleton code, and tools such as RTSystemEditor for connecting and controlling RT Components.

Currently, OpenRTM-aist supports C++, Python, and Java, and can operate on Windows, UNIX-like operating systems, and μITRON-based operating systems (C++ edition only).

In addition, SEC Corporation provides OpenRTM .NET, an OpenRTM-aist-compatible middleware implementation that enables the creation and execution of RTCs in .NET environments, including C#.

RTCs developed in different programming languages and running on different operating systems can be interconnected and operate cooperatively.
